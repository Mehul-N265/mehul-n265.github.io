      <h3>COVID-19: SYMPTOMS</h3>
      <p>
        COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected
        people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without
        hospitalization.
      </p>
      <h4>Most Common Symptoms:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>fever</li>
        <li>dry cough</li>
        <li>tiredness</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Less Common Symptoms:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>aches and pains</li>
        <li>sore throat</li>
        <li>diarrhoea</li>
        <li>conjunctivitis</li>
        <li>headache</li>
        <li>loss of taste or smell</li>
        <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Serious Symptoms:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
        <li>chest pain or pressure</li>
        <li>loss of speech or movement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always
        call before visiting your doctor or health facility. People with mild
        symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
        On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the
        virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.

      <h3>Precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19</h3>

      <ul class="prevention-tips">
        <li class="pre-items">
          Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand
          rub.
        </li>
        <li class="pre-items">
          Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
        </li>
        <li class="pre-items">
          Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
        </li>
        <li class="pre-items">Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
        <li class="pre-items">
          Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you
          cough or sneeze.
        </li>
        <li class="pre-items">Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
        <li class="pre-items">
          If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
          attention.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you
        to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread
        of viruses and other infections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing
        the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and
        should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the
        advice provided by your local health authority. For more information
