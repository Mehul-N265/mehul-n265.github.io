      <h3>COVID-19 Vaccination Drive:</h3>
      <p>
        Vaccination is an integral part to stop the dreadful coronavirus.
        Vaccination holds the most important part in fight against corona. We
        are the spreaders of this novel coronavirus. Therefore it is our duty to
        get vaccinated and eliminate the virus. There many false myths about our vaccines; these are not true.
         Do not listen to those and follow what the government says. Vaccines fully tested so there is no need to be afraid of them.
        There are some effects of the vaccines in some people, but these are temporary.
        Vaccination of oneself is the greatest contribution to the society.

      </p>
      <p>
        Even after vaccination you need to wear a mask and maintain social distance.
